# Ai_Akinator_web
I'm building an Akinator-style web application for the nFactorial program. The project is developed using Python and FastAPI, and leverages the OpenAI API to generate intelligent, dynamic questions in order to guess the character the user is thinking of. The goal is to create a smooth and engaging user experience through a responsive web interface.
